# data-structures-java
A repository for learning-by-doing. My main data-structures repository is [here](https://github.com/jay-tyler/data-structures),
written in Python. I'd like to replicate at least some of that same code in Java.

## Credits
* Coursera [course](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) on algorithms via Princeton, by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick.
The authors request not posting homework solutions publicly. (I won't, and if I really want to do something here akin to a problem, I'll at
least modify the API.)
